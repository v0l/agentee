# Cross-checks against openEMS

`cases.json` describes microstrip test structures. `agentee` and [openEMS](https://openems.de)
simulate each one with the same geometry and lumped 50 ohm ports, and `compare.py` puts the two
sets of S-parameters side by side with scikit-rf.

```sh
cargo run --release -p agentee-sim --example xcheck -- xcheck/cases.json target/xcheck
source ~/opt/openEMS/venv/bin/activate          # openEMS built with --python
python xcheck/openems_cases.py xcheck/cases.json target/xcheck
python xcheck/compare.py target/xcheck msl50 msl50_lossy stub stub_fine thin_lossy
```

The openEMS side uses a wider air box (8 mm), PML_8, the thirds rule on the strip edges,
`AddConductingSheet` for lossy copper (frequency dependent) and PEC otherwise.

## Results

| case | what | agentee | openEMS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `msl50` | 30 mm, 2.9 mm on 1.51 mm er 4.5, PEC | S21 within 0.08 dB, phase within 1.3 deg to 6 GHz | |
| `msl50` | power not in S11 or S21 at 5 GHz (radiation) | 0.032 dB | 0.089 dB |
| `msl50` | Z0 at 1.5 / 3.5 GHz from a 30 and a 45 mm line, 0.2 and 0.1 mm cells | 50.0 / 50.3, 49.9 / 50.3 ohm | 48.8 / 49.4, 48.9 / 49.5 ohm |
| `msl50_lossy` | same with tan 0.02 and 35 um copper, S21 at 1 / 3 / 5 GHz | -0.304 / -0.329 / -0.368 dB | -0.315 / -0.359 / -0.424 dB |
| `thin_lossy` | 0.3 mm on 0.15 mm air, 35 um copper, loss at 1 / 3 / 5 GHz | 0.041 / 0.048 / 0.052 dB | 0.045 / 0.050 / 0.054 dB |
| `thin_lossy` | the same, earlier model with the sheet resistance fixed at 3.5 GHz | 0.078 / 0.053 / 0.044 dB | |
| `stub` | 12 mm open stub, notch, 0.2 mm cells | 3.725 GHz | 3.525 GHz |
| `stub_fine` | the same, 0.1 mm cells | 3.725 GHz | 3.625 GHz |

Hammerstad-Jensen gives 49.4 ohm for `msl50` on an infinite substrate at DC.

Findings:

- Delay on plain lines agrees closely. The lossy line's gap grows with frequency by about as
  much as the lossless line's radiation gap, so dielectric and copper loss agree to about
  0.01 dB. agentee reads less radiation than openEMS; moving agentee's air box out from 1.5 mm
  to 8 mm does not change it, so the cause is still open.
- Copper loss first matched only at the band centre, off by sqrt(f) away from it, because the
  FDTD sheet resistance was fixed there while openEMS's sheet model is dispersive. The sheets
  now carry the full sqrt(j w) surface impedance and agree within 8% across the band.
- The first stub run put the notch 7% low: track ends and pour edges were not mesh lines, so an
  open stub's length snapped to a coarse cell. They are mesh lines now.
- agentee's edges now sit where the grid's effective edge meets the copper edge, which makes
  its impedance and the stub notch independent of the cell size (49.9 to 50.0 ohm and 3.725 GHz
  at both cells). openEMS still moves with its mesh (notch 3.70, 3.525, 3.625 GHz) and reads
  the 50 ohm line 2% lower than agentee and 1% under Hammerstad-Jensen. Which of the two is
  closer on this line is not settled.
- `thin_lossy` S11 and S21 differ by 0.7 dB and 0.2 dB because agentee widens the strip for its
  35 um thickness and openEMS's conducting sheet has none.
